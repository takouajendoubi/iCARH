    Implements the integrative conditional autoregressive horseshoe model 
    discussed in Jendoubi, T., & Ebbels, T. (2018). "Integrative analysis of 
    time course metabolic data and biomarker discovery". arXiv preprint <arXiv:1801.07767>.
    The package also provides functions to simulate data from the model, construct pathway matrices,
    post process and plot model parameters.
